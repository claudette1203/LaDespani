## Stack
Written in Typescript and powered by React. We use [Material UI](https://mui.com/) as our primary source of components. Any library is welcome if you want to use it, but keep in mind the design style.

## Contribute
To run the website locally, you must run `npm run dev` in the terminal.

All contributions are welcome; it is, after all, an event that is for students.
